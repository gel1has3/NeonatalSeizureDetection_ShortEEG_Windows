### Transformer Architecture 

### 1. Model Structure 

The model processes raw EEG signals in a sequence of well-defined steps, beginning with input preprocessing and culminating in a classification output. The core of the architecture is a multi-head attention mechanism followed by a feed-forward network, a configuration well-suited for capturing long-range dependencies within the temporal EEG data.


### 2. Detailed Data Flow

#### **2.1. Input Processing**

The process begins with the **raw EEG input** data, represented as a tensor of dimensions `[batch_size × num_channels × num_timepoints]`. This data undergoes **per-channel standardization**, where each channel's mean and standard deviation are used to normalize the values. This step is crucial for maintaining stable training and preventing certain channels from dominating the learning process.

#### **2.2. Positional and Temporal Encoding**

Following standardization, the model adds **positional encoding** to the data. This is achieved using a **sinusoidal encoding** scheme, which embeds temporal information into the data, allowing the model to understand the sequence of EEG signals over time. The tensor is then permuted from `[batch_size × num_channels × num_timepoints]` to `[num_timepoints × batch_size × num_channels]` to prepare it for the attention mechanism, which expects the sequence length (timepoints) as the first dimension.


#### **2.3. Transformer Encoder Block**

The prepared data enters the main transformer block, which consists of two primary sub-layers:

1.  **Multi-Head Self-Attention**: This layer enables the model to weigh the importance of different timepoints relative to each other. It performs a "self-attention" mechanism across the channels for each timepoint, effectively capturing **channel-wise contextual relationships**.
2.  **Feed-Forward Network (FFN)**: The output of the attention layer is then processed by a feed-forward network, which consists of two linear layers separated by a ReLU activation function. This non-linear transformation allows the model to learn more complex relationships from the attended features.

Crucially, the architecture incorporates **residual connections** around both the attention and FFN sub-layers. These connections, along with **layer normalization**, facilitate efficient gradient flow and enable the training of deeper networks. The skip connection from the attention block's output bypasses the FFN and is added back before the final layer normalization, a standard practice in transformer models.

#### **2.4. Final Classification**

The output of the transformer block is then flattened to a 2D tensor, concatenating the time and channel dimensions. This flattened vector is then fed into a **classification head**, which is a simple linear layer. This layer projects the learned features into the final output dimension, typically producing **logits** for binary or multi-class classification.

### 3. Conclusion

The EEG Transformer architecture is a robust and sophisticated model for EEG analysis. By leveraging the power of attention mechanisms, it can effectively capture both local and global dependencies within the data, leading to a strong performance in classification tasks. The use of standardization, positional encoding, and residual connections ensures that the model is both efficient to train and capable of learning from complex, high-dimensional EEG signals.


### Flowchart Summary 

##### 1. A["Raw EEG Input"]: dimensions as [batch_size × num_channels × num_timepoints]. 

##### 2. B["Per-Channel Standardization"]:   standardization step: X_hat = (X - mean) / (std + 1e-5).

##### 3. C["Positional Encoding Injection"]: This is the X_tilde = X_hat + self.positional_encoding line. The description "Sinusoidal Channel-Time Encoding".

##### 4. D["Tensor Permutation"]:  "Time → Batch Sequence" is an accurate, higher-level description of X_tilde.permute(2, 0, 1).

5. E["Multi-Head Self-Attention"]:  self.multihead_attn call.

6. F["Attention Output: Dropout + LayerNorm"]:  self.dropout(attn_output) and the subsequent list comprehension with self.norm1.

7. G["Feed-Forward Network"]: s the self.ffn sequential block.

8. H["Residual Connection + Layer Normalization"]: This is the self.norm2(ff_output + X_ring) line.  It  shows the skip connection (F -->|Skip Connection| H) that carries the output of the attention block to be added to the output of the feed-forward network. This is a key feature of the transformer architecture that the code implements.

9. I["Feature Flattening"]: This matches the O.view(O.size(0), -1) operation, preparing the data for the final classification layer.

10. J["Classification Head"]: This is the self.classifier linear layer.

11. K["Prediction Output"]: The final output returned by the function. The  "logits" is an accurate description of the raw outputs from the linear layer before a potential softmax function is applied.
